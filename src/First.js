          Hi, this is Abul, the first International Research Scholar through the
          FIRST@IITH initiative. I belong to Bangladesh, where I earned a
          bachelor's and master's degree in civil engineering. Because of the
          world-class facilities, the learning environment, and exposure to
          research have given me more confidence in competing with other
          institutions around the world. I would like to extend an invitation to
          you to join the IIT Hyderabad family. Thank you very much.
