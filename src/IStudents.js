            Hello, This is Raquel Fernández Peralta from Spain. I stayed in IIT
            Hyderabad as a visitor for a 3-month research for my PhD research
            work. My experience was very positive, the time I spent there helped
            to make progress in my thesis and to see things from a different
            perspective. Also, I had the opportunity to get to know another
            culture and I left with many good friends and experiences.{" "}
