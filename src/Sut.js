        <h3>About SUT</h3>
        <p className="libPara" data-aos="fade-right">
          Swinburne University of Technology is a world-class university
          creating social and economic impacts through science, technology and
          innovation. Founded in 1908 by the Honourable George and Ethel
          Swinburne as the ‘Eastern Suburbs Technical College’, Swinburne has
          continued to evolve, gaining university status in 1992. Swinburne has
          three campuses located in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne — at
          Hawthorn, Croydon and Wantirna — offering tertiary education for
          higher education as well as Pathways and Vocational Education (PAVE).
          We also have a fourth campus in Sarawak, Malaysia. The National
          Institute of Circus Arts is located in Prahran, Melbourne and we also
          offer a range of qualifications online through Swinburne Online and
          Open Universities Australia. In 2019, we unveiled new locations in
          Sydney and Vietnam, each offering a small suite of sought-after
          Swinburne courses, and also opened an office in Nanjing, China —
          further connecting us to some of the fast-growing regions in the
          world.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a dual-sector university, Swinburne offers higher education and
          Pathways and Vocational Education (PAVE). We offer courses in a broad
          range of disciplines and our close ties with industry provide students
          with opportunities for valuable workplace experiences during their
          studies. Swinburne researchers have a reputation for high-quality
          research with particular strengths in astronomy, physics, engineering,
          materials science, computer science and information technology, design
          and innovation, health sciences, neurosciences and mental health.
          Underpinned by leading digital technology platforms, Swinburne
          researchers are collaborating with industry through embedded
          partnerships to drive innovation and create impact. Since 2015,
          Swinburne has risen more than 200 places in the QS rankings and the
          current result confirms Swinburne’s place in the top 1% of
          universities globally in both the QS rankings and the latest ARWU
          rankings. In 2022, Swinburne was ranked as the 50th top university in
          the world under 50 years old by Times Higher Education.
