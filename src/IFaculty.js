          Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration (SPARC)
        </h3>
        <p className="libPara" data-aos="fade-right">
          The Scheme for Promotion of Academic and Research Collaboration
          (SPARC), an initiative of Ministry of Human Resource Development,
          Government of India, aims at improving the research ecosystem of
          India’s higher educational institutions by facilitating academic and
          research collaborations between top ranked Indian Institutions and
          globally ranked Foreign Institutions, through Joint Research Projects
          involving mobility of students and faculty. The SPARC Scheme is
          expected to have a major impact in providing the best international
          expertise to address major national problems, expose Indian
          academicians to the best collaborators abroad, enable international
          faculty to stay in India for a longer duration, provide Indian
          students an opportunity to work in the world class laboratories, to
          develop strong bilateral relationships in research, and improve the
          international ranking of Indian Institutions.
          <br />
          <br />
          28 Countries have been identified for collaboration in the first phase
          of SPARC. There will be a set of Nodal Institutions (NI) in India, one
          for each participating foreign country, who will be responsible for
          hand holding, guiding Indian institutes and coordination of activities
          between the participating Indian Institutions in India and the
          respective foreign country as well as act as the liaision with the
          SPARC teams.
